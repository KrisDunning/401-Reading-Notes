# Prep-work Data Structures and Algorithms

## Discussion Questions

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
> How well the data structure scales (Big0). Each data structure has strength and weaknesses. We should consider how that algorithm accomplishes what we desire to do with the data.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
> Make sure to include a base case inside the recursive function. The base case is where the function does not call itself.

## 8 Common Data Structures

1) Arrays
2) Linked Lists
3) Stacks-LIFO
4) Queues-FIFO
5) Hash Table
6) Trees
7) Heaps
8) Graphs

## Things I want to know more about

How to understand the BigO calculation. The video covered the basics but I still need to get some more practice in.
