# Read 31 - Context API

## Discussion Questions

### Context API

What can React Context provide your app?
> Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

Why might we use Context?
> Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

Why should we use it sparingly?
> It makes component reuse more difficult.

### Awesome React Context links

Consume content from (at least) two of the Awesome React Context links. Share your take-away from each:

Takeaway 1:
> I read the free code camp article on context and it basically showed how he added a container to a popup and was able to use context to toggle local and global state. So the popup will be shown or hidden based on which state is used.

Takeaway 2:
> I read Kent C. Dodd's article about optimizing React Context. He basically says there are better options to optimize context and reccomends using Remix. He basically says the simple option is to split the state and reducer into two seperate context providers. That way you only have to call one when needed. This can help save on re-renders.

## Reflection

Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
> I think React Native might be kinda cool to see if I can make and Android or Iphone app with it.

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
> Mostly to actually get my 10/10's on the topics. They all have value and I should be able to at least complete, test and document each lab.

## Things I want to know more about

Redux and now Remix. There are a lot of cool React based tools and frameworks to learn about. And it would be nice to have a fully decked out React project for my portfolio. Even better if I could make it a mobile, web and desktop app!
