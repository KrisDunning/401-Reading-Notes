# Read 43 - OSS Contributions and Frameworks

## Discussion Questions

### Gatsby and next.js Resources

Teach us two things about Next.js
> Both static rendering (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a page-by-page basis.  
> Next.js has integrated TypeScript support.

Teach us two things about Gatsby.js
> Gatsby plug-ins make it easy to import functionality to your page.
> Gatsby uses GraphQL to query for data. It saves the data in a built in layer, the "GraphQL Data Layer".

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
> I heard great things about both gatsby and next.js. I wouldn't hate to take a basic react site and create it through multiple frameworks.

## Things I want to know more about

How similar are all these frameworks? How easy would it be to migrate a single app across all these different frameworks.
