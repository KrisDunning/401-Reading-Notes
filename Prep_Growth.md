# Prep-work The Growth Mindset

## Upgrade technical skills with deliberate practice

Deliberate practice summarized - "Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individuals performance.

Key Ideas behind deliberate practice:

- Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
- Repeated often
- Feedback on results are continously available
- Highly demanding mentally
- Difficult
- Requires good goals

## Measuring Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence quiz scores all in the high teens for the categories: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management. I feel like the quiestions, more than the scores, offered the ability for self-replection. Though I am quite happy to know my self scores are on the higher end.

## Assessing Bias

Scored in the high 70's which means I made progress but still have room for improvement. The area of strength for me was "What is Bias" and my areas for growth were "Effective courage" and "Four ways to Act".

## Things I want to know more about

How do I think I can incorporate deliberate practice? Is doing code challenges enough? Do I need to make a list of platforms/technologies to practice next?
