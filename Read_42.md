# Read 42- Ethics In tech

## Discussion Questions

Review at least one article from both “Ethics in the workplace” and “Ethics in Technology” sections below and write how each of them relates to ethics in technology.  
Do you agree or disagree with these articles? What stuck out to you specifically from each article?

 1)Project Dragonfly, Google’s censored search engine

>Google has had a long history of backlash over their usage of the technology and user information in their possession. During the time frame of this article there was also a lot of tension between China and the US over trade and the chinese governments internment of Uyghers. Google's position was that it was an exploratory project and the employee's position was that they were not going to support the company in the deployment of this exploratory project. The ethical dilemma lies in whether the employees would continue to work for a company who they believed were not acting in an ethical manner. Google stood to lose too much compared to what they would gain in moving forward with the project. They eventually shut down the project. I would say that I agrees with the employees in this case. Google is a company and can do what they want, but there are always repercussions to decisions of this size. Specifically I would say the former employee, Brandon Downey, quote at the end of the article stuck out the most.

2)Cyber-Security of self driving cars

>For self-driving cars the ethical question is how can we offer the technology, safely and securely, when we know the implications of a security breach. The "trolley problem" has been discussed over and over for years to relate to how do we determine a "right" answer and apply it to AI. Who will take responsibility if something bad happens with a AI driven car. What regulations should the government require and which should the manufacturers be responsible for. Add in the fact that there is a demonstrated ability for bad actors to influence control over AI controlled vehicles and currently its a hot mess. I am all for self driving cars but there will need to be a common consensus on what will be our cultural acceptable level of risk and responsibility. I would agree with the article author that, as of now, we only have semi-automated self driving cars. We are in the infancy of this technology and it would be unrealistic to think that it is a perfected technology. What stuck out to me in the article is that the government already has a 15 point safety assessment for self-driving cars. I wasnt aware that regulation had already begun at the government level.
