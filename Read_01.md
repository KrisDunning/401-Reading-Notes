## Discussion Questions

How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

> It is an enhanced version of the chrome browser engine that lets me use javascript to run programs on the computer.

What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

> Node is a program that executes javascript on our computers.

What is Node used for?

> Installing and running various build tools to help automate the development process. It also allows us to use javascript on the server. It can also be used as a scripting language to automate tasks. It can also be used to build a command line tool. Node can be used to build cross platform apps and even NodeBots (robots).

## Things I want to know more about

I want to learn more about the NodeBots. My kid loves robots, so I will probably check out the linked article on said topic.
