# Read 11- Event Driven Applications

## Discussion Questions

### Event Driven Programming

What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
> Event Emmiter

What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
> It reduces the need for one piece of code to "reach into" another piece of code to retrieve information. If the code can emit a call then the other code can hear and respond appropriately.

Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
> It would be like a trained birding dog. You whistle(event emitter) and the dog(listender) would understand and respond appropriately. It would sit, fetch, etc. Useful on back-end to make event driven code that is self-contained.
