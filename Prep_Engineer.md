# Prep-work Engineering Readings

## Discussion Questions

What is one thing I bring to this career (and potential employer) that nobody else can?

> I feel that I bring a high level of worker competency. I am trained in leadership and followership. I have a breadth of knowledge in other types on building things, from electronics to stone walls, to tile kitchens. Techniques I have learned I believe can help me solve problems.

What are 3 things I can do to 'un-stick myself' whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic or feature?

> 1) Prioritize what goal I want to achieve. Say no to things that wont help me achieve my goal/task.
> 2) Write down the problem in plain english. Break the problem into pieces, solve sub-pieces, then convert into code.

## Things I want to know more about

How can I better answer the first discussion question? How can I sell my uniqueness to potential employers.
